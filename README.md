# Frontend Template
A repository to experiment with a front end setup for Umbraco / CMS driven sites using VueJS + Tailwind

## Why?
I really love VueJS and am trying to use it more and more in my projects, however most examples I've found revolve around it's use for web APPLICATION's or SPAs, rather than server rendered WEBSITE's backed by a CMS like I mostly work with.

For me, CMS / Website based dev has a few requirements that don't tend to fit too well with the usual setups.

1. Pages and thus component usage on the page are usually decided dynamically, thus a core Vue instance can't exist to orchestrate the page.
2. Pages need to have server rendered content on them to ensure a degree of SEO friendlyness.

Becuase of this, it requires a slightly different way of thinking so this repository is just a place for me to experiment with an ideal setup.

As well as VueJS, I'm also looking into the Tailwind CSS framework as I'm really starting to see the benefits of functional CSS.
